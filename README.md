# üöó Vehicle AI Detection App

## üéØ Overview
This is a simple yet powerful Python application that detects and tracks vehicles in a video using **YOLOv8** (from the `ultralytics` library).  
It can process live camera feed or pre-recorded traffic videos and automatically identify cars, drawing green bounding boxes around them.

This project was created as part of an **Artificial Intelligence master‚Äôs portfolio**, focusing on real-world applications for **autonomous vehicles and smart traffic systems**.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Features
- Real-time **vehicle detection** using YOLOv8  
- **Tracking** with unique IDs per vehicle  
- Works with **live webcam** or **video files (e.g., `traffic.mp4`)**  
- Adjustable confidence threshold for precision  
- Output video automatically saved as `vehicle_detection_output.mp4`
